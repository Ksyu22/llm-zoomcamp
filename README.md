# LLMs and RAGs Bootcamp Project 🤖📚

This repository contains my work from a 10-week bootcamp on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The course focuses on practical applications of LLMs, guiding participants to build an AI bot capable of answering questions about a knowledge base.

## Course Outline 📅

- **[Introduction to LLMs and RAG](https://github.com/Ksyu22/llm-zoomcamp/tree/main/01-intro)** 🧠
  - Understanding the basics and significance of LLMs and RAG in AI applications.

- **[Open-Source and Self-Hosting LLMs]**(https://github.com/Ksyu22/llm-zoomcamp/tree/main/02-open-source) 🌐
  - Exploring open-source LLMs and methods to self-host these models.

- **Vector Databases** 🗃️
  - Learning about vector databases and their role in enhancing the capabilities of LLMs.

- **LLM Orchestration** 🔧
  - Techniques for orchestrating multiple LLMs to improve performance and efficiency.

- **Monitoring and Guardrails** 🛡️
  - Implementing monitoring systems and safety measures to ensure robust and secure AI operations.

- **Tips and Tricks** 💡
  - Practical advice and best practices for working with LLMs and RAGs.

## Project Goals 🎯

By the end of the course, I aim to:

- Build a functional AI bot that can answer queries about a given knowledge base. 🤖❓
- Develop a strong foundation in the practical applications of LLMs & RAGs. 📚🚀

## Status 🛠️

This is a work in progress as the first iteration of the course is scheduled to run in Summer 2024. Stay tuned for updates and completed modules. 📅✨
