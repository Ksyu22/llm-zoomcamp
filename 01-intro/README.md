# Module: Introduction to LLMs and RAG in AI Applications

## Theory

### Understanding the Basics and Significance of LLMs and RAG

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** are advanced AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data. They excel at understanding and generating human-like text, making them powerful tools for various natural language processing tasks.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** enhances LLMs by combining their generative capabilities with information retrieval techniques. RAG allows models to pull relevant information from external databases or documents, improving their ability to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers. This integration is crucial for applications requiring up-to-date or specialized knowledge beyond the model's training data.

## Technical Description

### Building the First RAG

In this practical module, we implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the following components:

- **LLM: Chat-GPT3.5-Turbo (OpenAI API)**
  - A language model from OpenAI that generates human-like text based on the input it receives.

- **Knowledge DB:**
  - **Custom Search Engine**: A tailored search engine designed to index and retrieve relevant information based on specific queries.
  - **ElasticSearch**: An open-source search engine for textual data, providing efficient and scalable search capabilities.

By integrating Chat-GPT3.5-Turbo with a custom search engine and ElasticSearch, we create a system that leverages text generation and retrieval methods to provide precise and contextually informed responses.
